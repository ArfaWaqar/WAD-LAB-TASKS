    Spring is the season of renewal and beauty, when nature awakens after the cold and silence of winter. 
    Fresh green leaves sprout on trees, flowers bloom in vibrant colors, and the air becomes filled with 
    a gentle fragrance. Birds return, singing melodious tunes, and the days grow longer and warmer. 
    Spring is often seen as a symbol of hope, growth, and new beginnings, inspiring joy and energy in peoples lives. It 
    is a time when the world seems refreshed, bright, and full of life. </pre>

    Summer is the season of warmth, brightness, and energy, when the sun shines in 
    its full glory and days become long and lively. It is a time of vacations, outdoor fun,
    and relaxation, as people enjoy trips to beaches, parks, and cool evening gatherings. 
    Nature is full of life, with blooming gardens, ripe fruits, and golden fields under clear skies.
